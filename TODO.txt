# RECOMMENDATIONS
feature: on startup, generate 3 novel bookmark recommendations based on your most recently used bookmarks.
feature: bookmark name recommender. creates an index of how descriptive each bookmark name is
  if it's bad, recommend name updates using the bookmark title generator (fetch html and summarize). The user can review these and choose to apply them.
feature: concept of "recommendations": e.g.
  "your new bookmark should go here",
  "this old bookmark should be renamed",
  "your old bookmark is miscategorized, it should go here"

# SORTING
feature: group bookmarks into subfolders by domain within category folder - Generate descriptive title for grouped bookmarks
feature: overflow _more folder for 10+ items in category folder
feature: within each folder, use history to check each the occurences of each domain, and sort by most used.

  If history is not available, fallback to lastUsed

# CLASSIFICATION
feature: given a new bookmark, check if there is an appropriate classification, and if so, assign it to the appropriate folder
feature: given a new bookmark, if there is no appropriate classification, rebuild the folder hierarchy and reassign bookmarks
feature: improve generated classifications by doing this in batches:
  (say 10 batches of 15 so 150 categories generated independently)
  then generate the final 15 classifications based on the most common from the 150
  this can fix the context size limitation for the Prompt
ux: It's cool to see the classification progress in the UI. But why not automatically proceed through the steps, requiring only one click?
ux: Should not be able to restart the step after pressing it once without clearing the data first (button should turn yellow or green)

ux: The last minted snapshot should be highlighted in the UI, visually it gets lost under pinned snapshots. Pinned could be light blue, newest could be green.
